## 0.7.0

- Update to clj-ssh 0.5.10
  Fixes an issue with the session? predicate.

- Allow :options to be nil

- Change forward-to-local, unforward-to-local arguments

- Enforce State schema

## 0.6.0

- Add jump-host support
  This changes the arguments for open to take a target sequence of hosts to
  connect though.  Each element in the sequence is a map with :endpoint and
  :credenttial keys.

  Also changes to always use an in-memory agent, initialised with the keys
  in the system agent.

- Add :ssh-agent-options to open options
  The :ssh-agent-options can be used to pass options to the ssh-agent used
  for the connection.  Removes all logic around agent construction.

- Use local ssh-agent when :temp-key is true
  To avoid temporary keys being added to the system ssh-agent, use a local
  agent when :temp-key is true.

- Make standoff increase in connection attempts
  In order to reduce the number of connection attempts back-off connection
  attempts by a constant factor (fixed at 1.5 for now).

  Also improves logging of connection attempts.
